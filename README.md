Main Learning Objectives:
Learn how to put together a server and website from the back-end
The interaction of databases with websites
The MVC design model
How routes/ routers work

Challenges I faced:
I tend to have problems with digesting syntax. I have trouble reading code and understanding what exactly it does. While I understood the more conceptual aspects of the tutorial (namely, the learning objectives I listed above), actually digesting or writing bits of code proved to be challenging. However, I got to practice quite a bit of debugging because of my shortcomings with implementing my own code during the "challenge" parts of the tutorial. 

How this tutorial will help me in the future:
The role of databases in websites has really stuck to me after doing the whole project. It almost seems like a lot of websites are just interactive databases with a face. They're obviously more than that, but I recognized the importance of databases and understanding them. Learning about routes has stuck with me as well. I picture routes as traffic directors you see in densely populated areas.
